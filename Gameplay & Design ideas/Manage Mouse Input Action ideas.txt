How MangeMouseInputAction should work
* It should check the mouse's position and keep track of that all the time.
* If the mouse has been clicked, then the mouse's position should be checked against a list 
  actionable Actors. If the mouse was clicked inside of any relevant actors, then the proper action should 
  be taken.

List of actionable actors
* Any button
* Any settlement, road, mine, or farm able to be built upon
