What needs to happen if they have enough resources?
* I need to check if the connecting road is built

Once all of the checks are passed, what needs to happen?
* The unbuiltSettlement needs to be removed from cast, and a new built Settlement needs to be added. 
* The settlement2Built bool needs to be changed from false to true in Constructions class
* New unbuilt roads, farms, and mines need to be added to the cast.

Separate
* I will need to make a new class called BuildService in Services. This will make all of the changes to 
the cast.
